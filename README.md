## Notice

1. When there are no files to change, there will be no PRs.
2. The previous PR is updated when it has not been merged and there are new changes.
3. If you don't like the red Ã— when no files to change, add `continue-on-error: true` below the step.
4. Folders that are empty or contain filtered files will also show up in the directory, so keep unnecessary files in other directories.
5. Tables of contents are sorted in ascending lexicographical order and can be named using a format such as "01 - article title.md" to ensure the table of contents is in the order you want.
